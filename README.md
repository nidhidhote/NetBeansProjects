Interface implementation using simple functionalities.

Query 1. What is interface?

         Interface is as similar as a class in which methods are only declared which are furthur overidden. Interface are  implemented by          classes by using keyword implements.By using class object we can access the overriden methods declared in interface and                    define in class. A class can implements more than one interface at a time which helps JAVA in providing multiple inheritence.
         
Query 2. Can we declare methods Static inside Interface?

         Yes, we can declare methods static inside Interface. Only compulsion is that method needs to be define at the time of            
         declaration. Static methods are accessed by using interface name.
         Syntax: interface_name.method_name
         
Query 3. Is it important to write method body for static method in interface? If yes than why?
         
         Yes, reason is static methods cannot be overriden so definition is must otherwise there is no use of creating that method.
       
Query 4. By default members of interface are of what type?

         By default all members are public, final, default and methods are abstract .
